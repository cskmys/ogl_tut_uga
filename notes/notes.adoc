* Sequence
** Initialize the widow manager software: *glfwInit*
** Set the properties: *glfwWindowHint*
** Setup window:
*** Create window: *glfwCreateWindow*
*** Make it current one: *glfwMakeContextCurrent*
*** Setup input mode of GLFW: *glfwSetInputMode*
** Setup OpenGL: *glewInit*

[WARNING]
====
If you call any opengl apis before this, program will crash
====
** Load shader programs(if you have one): *LoadShaders*(defined in common/shader.cpp)
** __Do your thing__
** While window is open or esc key not pressed
*** clear the screen: *glClear*
*** run shader programs(if you have one): *glUseProgram*
*** __Do your thing__
*** swap buffers: *glfwSwapBuffers*
*** poll event: *glfwPollEvents*
** Cleanup
*** Delete any buffers created: *glDeleteBuffers*
*** Delete any vertex arrays created: *glDeleteVertexArrays*
*** Delete shader programs: *glDeleteProgram*
** Close window and terminate GLFW: *glfwTerminate*
* VAO: Vertex Array Object

** Right hand rule
*** x: thumb to right

* 2 shaders required
** usage
*** 2 shader programs in separate files
*** Programmed in GLSL(GL Shader Language)
*** Compiled at run-time during every execution of application
*** Shaders are not directly accessible, only an ID is return when they are created
** Types
*** Vertex shader:
+
Executed for each vertex. Each vertex can have numerous attributes : A position, one or several colours,
one or several texture coordinates, lots of other things.
+
[NOTE]
====
Max number of attributes is defined by GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS value
====
**** Steps
***** Create buffer and pass data to it
****** buffer for vertices position created using *glGenBuffers*
****** *glBindBuffer* is used to describe above buffer as array buffer
****** co-ord positions data passed to buffer using *glBufferData*
***** Link buffer to an attribute of vertex for use by shader
****** Attribute __n__ of vertices is enabled using *glEnableVertexAttribArray*
****** buffer created above linked to Attribute 0 using *glBindBuffer*
****** *glVertexAttribPointer* is used to describe the data in buffer
****** in vert shader the Attribute __n__ containing co-ord positions is received as input using *in* as variable of
the data type appropriate to the one that fits the description in glVertexAttribPointer(in this case *vec3*) with the
attribute position using *location=__n__* for nth attribute
***** Using the value received
****** normally value received is used by itself or with built-in variables. Ex: *gl_Position* in this case.
*** Fragment shader
+
Executed for each sample.
+
[NOTE]
====
Since we are using 4x anti-aliasing, we have 4 sample/pixel
====
+
Colour is assigned using this shader.

**** Steps
****** nothing much as of now
